# 🎙️ Speech Emotion Recognition
---
A machine learning and signal processing project that detects human emotions from speech audio. This system analyzes recorded or streamed speech, extracts meaningful audio features, and classifies the emotional state of the speaker. Applications range from human-computer interaction to customer service analytics and mental health monitoring.

---

## 📋 Dataset / Input Overview

* **Input:** Speech audio samples (e.g., `.wav` files) containing spoken sentences with different emotional tones.
* **Target Labels:** Emotions such as *happy*, *sad*, *angry*, *neutral*, etc. (based on dataset or labeling).
* **Features:**

  * MFCCs (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients)
  * Chroma features
  * Mel spectrogram
  * Zero Crossing Rate, Spectral Centroid, etc.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Audio Feature Extraction:** Extracts MFCCs, Chroma, and other acoustic features from speech.
* **Emotion Classification:** Predicts the emotional state of the speaker.
* **Data Visualization:** Plots feature distributions and confusion matrices.
* **Scalable:** Can adapt to different datasets or more emotion categories.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Audio Processing:** Librosa
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Notebook Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📈 Methodology

1. **Preprocessing:**

   * Loads audio files, normalizes volume, trims silence.
2. **Feature Extraction:**

   * Computes MFCCs, chroma, and mel spectrogram features using Librosa.
3. **Model Training:**

   * Uses classifiers like SVM, Random Forest, or MLP (depending on your notebook).
4. **Evaluation:**

   * Computes accuracy, precision, recall, and displays a confusion matrix.
5. **Prediction:**

   * Allows input of new audio samples for emotion prediction.

## 🎯 Usage

### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdelrahman-abozarifa04/Speech-Emotion-Recognition.git
cd Speech-Emotion-Recognition
```

### Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Speech_Project_(Emotion_Analysis_from_Speech).ipynb
```

### How to test:

* Run the cells to train the model on your dataset.
* Load a new audio file to predict its emotional state.
